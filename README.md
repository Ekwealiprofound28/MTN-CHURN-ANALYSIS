- Better competitor price was another reason for Churn. A price survey should be made to understand the better offers this competitors offer and adjustments be made where      necessary.
- Poor Network situation is another Reason .This is a situation that should be looked into by people who are meant to, to ensure the quality of Network is strengthen and       Stable.
